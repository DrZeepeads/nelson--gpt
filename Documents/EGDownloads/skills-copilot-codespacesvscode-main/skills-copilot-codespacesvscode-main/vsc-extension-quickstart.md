# VS Code Extension Quickstart

## What's in the Folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for a VS Code extension
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the properties of the extension
* `extension.js` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your extension
* `test/` - this directory contains the test suite for the extension

## Get up and Running
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
* Type "Calculate Numbers"
* See the result in the information message

## Make Changes
* You can rewrite/replace the code in `extension.js`
* You can also modify `package.json` to change the command name or add new commands

## Explore the API
* Check out the VS Code API documentation at https://code.visualstudio.com/api

## Run Tests
* Open the debug viewlet and run the "Extension Tests" launch configuration
* Or run `npm test` to test the extension
